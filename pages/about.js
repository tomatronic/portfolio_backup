                            <p>I'm Tom Spencer, a user experience designer based just outside of sunny Brighton, UK.</p>
                            <p>Being a UX designer allows me to solve complex problems and bring the end user a pleasurable experience. I make sure that products are enjoyable, accessible and beautiful to look at. I have a passion for getting fully immersed in a problem and experimenting with a range of possible solutions.</p>
                            <p>Seeing the impact of how I can influence a user's behaviour within a product or application fascinates me. Being empathetic and understanding helps ensure that I can make a product not just work for its intended users but be something they feel comfortable with.</p>
                            <p>I'm always looking for opportunities for collaboration. <a href="mailto:tom.m.spencer+portfolio@gmail.com">Reach out and let's chat!</a></p>
