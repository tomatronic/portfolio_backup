                        I'm a <b>UX Designer</b>
                        &nbsp;based in Brighton, UK. I have 10 years of design experience and plan on many more.<br /><br />

                            <p>Being a UX designer allows me to solve complex problems and bring the end user a pleasurable experience. I make sure that products are enjoyable, accessible and beautiful to look at. I have a passion for getting fully immersed in a problem and experimenting with a range of possible solutions.</p>
                            <p>Seeing the impact of how I can influence a user's behaviour within a product or application fascinates me. Being empathetic and understanding helps ensure that I can make a product not just work for its intended users but be something they feel comfortable with.</p>
                            <p>I'm currently based just outside of sunny Brighton, UK. You'll usually find me hiking on the South Downs with my partner, paddle boarding at sea or adventuring around the world.</p>
